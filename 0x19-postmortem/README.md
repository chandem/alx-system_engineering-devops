# Postmortem

Issue Summary:

Duration: 4 hours (10:00 AM - 2:00 PM EST)
Impact: Users were unable to access the website, leading to a 50% decrease in traffic during the outage.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the load balancer resulted in a denial of service (DoS) attack on the web server.

Timeline:

10:00 AM - The issue was detected by an engineer who received an alert from the monitoring system.
10:05 AM - The engineer checked the web server and found that it was unresponsive. The engineer assumed that the server was overloaded and began investigating possible causes.
10:30 AM - After investigating, the engineer found that the load balancer was misconfigured and was sending an excessive number of requests to the web server.
11:00 AM - The engineer attempted to fix the issue by adjusting the load balancer settings but found that the issue persisted.
12:00 PM - The engineer consulted with the network team, who identified the cause of the issue as a DoS attack on the web server.
1:00 PM - The network team implemented a solution to mitigate the attack and restored normal traffic to the website.
2:00 PM - The issue was resolved, and the website was fully functional.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer, which resulted in a DoS attack on the web server. The load balancer was configured to send too many requests to the web server, overwhelming it and causing it to crash.

To resolve the issue, the network team implemented a solution to mitigate the attack. They blocked the IP addresses responsible for the attack and adjusted the load balancer settings to prevent a similar attack from occurring in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar outages from occurring in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

1. Regular load testing will be conducted to ensure that the load balancer is configured correctly and can handle peak traffic.
2. The monitoring system will be improved to provide more detailed alerts in case of similar incidents.
3. Network security will be enhanced to prevent DoS attacks, including the use of intrusion detection and prevention systems.
4. The incident response plan will be updated to ensure a quicker response time and better coordination between teams.

Tasks to address the issue:

1. Review load balancer configuration and ensure that it is optimized for peak traffic.
2. Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to prevent DoS attacks.
3. Conduct regular load testing to ensure that the system can handle peak traffic.
4. Update the incident response plan to improve coordination between teams during outages.
